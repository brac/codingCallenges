# print tree
Dont put it in an iffe since it's just a file. Since it's not a browser don't bother.

line 6, to exit on height less than 4
console.warn
process.exit(1)
`echo $?` to get the exit of the last command

line 42.
There has to be a math solution, which would be a better solution.
TDD it

const good = Array(20).fill().map({_, i} => determineWidth(i+5))

Math.pow()

write a function to determin the number of Xs. It will take the treeWidth and the lineNumber,

Run nodemon to update this on every file save.

use `Array(20).fil().map((_,i) => i)`

get rid of numX,, it is `i + i + 1`

Dont even need the width.


# substring array
Not a string, but an array

Dry it up, you can slice with a variable. Don't have duplicate code.
